Here's a map of all places I've traveled to for conferences during my PhD. Maybe we've crossed paths there! :)

<!--<p>This map is generated from a Jupyter Notebook file in <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb">talkmap.ipynb</a>, which mines the location fields in the .md files in _talks/.</p>-->
