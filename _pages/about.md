I'm Maria Paola, but you can call me Paola for short :)

I'm an astrophysicist and I'm interested in stars, stellar evolution, stellar remnants, compact objects... You name it! 
Currently I'm working in the field of gravitational-wave astronomy and black hole dynamics, but I'm always open to learn more.

I'm a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics (ITA/ZAH)](https://www.zah.uni-heidelberg.de/welcome), Heidelberg University.
I work with [Michela Mapelli](http://web.pd.astro.it/mapelli/) in the [DEMOBLACK](http://demoblack.com/) group.
