title: "Impact of gas hardening on the population properties of hierarchical black hole mergers in AGN discs"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/agn-paper-1
excerpt: 'Hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are unique among formation channels of binary black holes
 (BBHs) because they are likely associated with electromagnetic counterparts and can e ciently lead to the mass growth of BHs.
 Here, we explore the impact of gas accretion and migration traps on the evolution of BBHs in AGNs. We have developed a new fast
 semi-analytic model, that allows us to explore the parameter space while capturing the main physical processes involved. We find
 that an e ective exchange of energy and angular momentum between the BBH and the surrounding gas (i.e., gas hardening) during
 inspiral greatly enhances the e ciency of hierarchical mergers, leading to the formation of intermediate-mass BHs (up to 104 M) and
 triggering spin alignment. Moreover, our models with e cient gas hardening show both an anticorrelation between the BBH mass
 ratio and the e ective spin and a correlation between the primary BH mass and the e ective spin. In contrast, if gas hardening is
 ine cient, the hierarchical merger chain is already truncated after the first two or three generations. We compare the BBH population
 in AGNs with other dynamical channels as well as isolated binary evolution.'
